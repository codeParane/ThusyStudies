# CSS 
  > Basic
	- Applying CSS
	There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML
		Inline - Inline styles are plonked straight into the HTML tags using the style attribute
		<p style="color: red">text</p>
		Internal - Embedded, or internal, styles are used for the whole page. Inside the head element, the style tags surround all of the styles for the page.
		<style>
			p {	color: red; }
		</style>
		External - External styles are used for the whole, multiple-page website. There is a separate CSS file
		styles.css
		p { color: red; }

	- CSS Syntex   h1{color: red;}
		selector {properties : value;} 

	- Selectors - CSS are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute, and more.
		element Selector - element selector selects elements based on the element name.
		id selector :  uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.  <div id="cls"></div>     -  #cls{}
		css selector : selects elements with a specific class attribute. - <div class="cls"></div>     -  .cls{}
		universal selector : Selects all elements. Optionally, it may be restricted to a specific namespace or to all namespaces. - * div{//select all div}
		attribute selectors   : 
			[attr]  - select Elements which have particular attribute
			[attr=value] - select elements with a specified attribute and value.

	- Combinators : // EX_CSS_1
	
	- Pseudo-classes : llow the selection of elements based on state information that is not contained in the document tree.
		a:visited will match all <a> elements that have been visited by the user.

	- Pseudo-elements represent entities that are not included in HTML.
		p::first-line will match the first line of all <p> elements.

	- properties:  inside curly brackets, which simply take the form of words such as color, font-weight or background-color.

	- values : There are many property-specific units for values used in CSS, but there are some general units that are used by a number of properties 
	  	px (such as font-size: 12px) is the unit for pixels.
	  	em (such as font-size: 2em) is the unit for the calculated size of a font. So “2em”, for example, is two times the current font size.
	  	pt (such as font-size: 12pt) is the unit for points, for measurements typically in printed media.
	  	% (such as width: 80%) is the unit for… wait for it… percentages.
	
	- Colors : CSS brings 16,777,216 colors. can take the form of a name, an RGB (red/green/blue) value or a hex code.
		predeifined : it include aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow. transparent is also a valid value.
		RGB : RGB value are from 0 to 255, 0 being the lowest level (no red, for example), 255 being the highest level (full red, for example). 
			These values can also be a percentage.   rgb(255,0,0),   rgb(100%,0%,0%)
		Hexadecimal : generally used to the decimal number system (base-10, from 0 to 9), but hexadecimal has 16 digits, from 0 to f. 
			prefixed with (#) and can be three or six digits in length. 
			Basically, the three-digit version is a compressed version of the six-digit #ff0000 becomes #f00, #cc9966 becomes #c96
		we can use it for color:for font color; background-color: to change the color of background;
	
	- Text : using it alter the size and shape of the text on a web page with a range of properties.
		font-family : The purpose of this is that if the user does not have the first font you specify, 
			the browser will go through the list until it finds one it does have. 
			This is useful because different computers sometimes have different fonts installed. 
		font-size : font-size sets the size of the font (12pt, 12px, 12%, 12em)
		font-weight : it states whether the text is bold or not (bold(700), normal(400), bolder, lighter, 100 - 900.)
		font-style : it states whether the text is italic or not. It can be font-style: italic or font-style: normal.
		text-decoration : it states whether the text has got a line running under, over, or through it.(underline, overline, line-through, none)
		text-transform : will change the case of the text.(Capitalize, Uppercase, lowercase, none)
		Text spacing : p { letter-spacing: 0.5em; word-spacing: 2em; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center; }
		* h2{font: italic bold 12px calibri;} - short hand
	
	- Margins and Padding : two most commonly used properties for spacing-out elements.
		Margin : space outside something h2{margin : 10px;}
		padding : space inside something div{padding : 10px;}
		* The four sides of an element can also be set individually. 
		margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, 
		padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left
		{padding:10px, 5px, 10px, 5px}, {margin:10px, 2px, 10px, 2px} - short hand
	
	- borders : applied to most HTML elements within the body.
		border-style : Set the style of border (solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset and outset)
		border-width : sets the width of the border (border-width:2px;)
			* can use separtely border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width and border-left-width.
		border-color : sets the color (h1{border-color: red;})
		* h1{border:2px solid red;} - short hand
