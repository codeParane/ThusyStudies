    - Rounded Corners
      Border radius : used to add a corner to each corner of a box.
      Multiple values : border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius, 
        and border-bottom-left-radius can also be used to target specific corners.
        border-radius: 6px 12px 18px 24px - short hand
    
    - Shadows : shining a torch over web page
      Box Shadows : is the standard CSS property to get Shadow
        box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px 1px #999
        1 - horizontal offset — how far the shadow is nudged to the right (or left if it’s negative)
        2 - vertical offset — how far the shadow is nudged downwards (or upwards if it’s negative)
        3 - blur radius — the higher the value the less sharp the shadow. (“0” being absolutely sharp). This is optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.
        4 - spread distance — the higher the value, the larger the shadow (“0” being the inherited size of the box). This is also optional — omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.
        5 - color. That’s optional, too.
      Inner shadow : also apply shadows to the inside of a box by adding “inset” to the list
        box-shadow: inset 0 0 7px 5px #ddd;
      Text Shadows : apply shadows to the outline of text
        text-shadow: -2px 2px 2px #999;
        1 - horizontal offset
        2 - vertical offset
        3 - blur radius (optional)
        4 - color (optional, omitting this will make the shadow the same color as the text itself)
    
    - Universal, Child, and Adjacent Selectors
      Universal Selectors (“ * ”) Select all in web page
      Child selectors (“>”) used to specify something that is a child of something
      Adjacent selectors (“+”) used to target an adjacent sibling of an element, essentially, something immediately following something

    - Advanced Colors :  CSS 3 also allows HSL — hue, saturation, and lightness and stipulating transparency.
      Alpha transparency : rgba(0,0,0,0)
        rgb takes normal 3 value but that fourth value level of transparency, “1” opaque, “0” transparent. 
      Hue, saturation, and lightness hsl(36, 100%, 50%) 
        control over the aspects of a color’s shade rather than its logical ingredients.
        Hue - 0 to 360, taken from a typical color wheel, where “0” (and “360”) is red, “120” is green and “240” is blue.
        Saturation - 0% (none, so a level of grey depending on the lightness) to 100%
        Lightness - 0% (black) to 100% (white), 50% being “normal”.
      HSLa : transparency and HSL combined hsla(0, 75%, 75%, 0.5)
    
    - At rules : encapsulate a bunch of CSS rules and apply them to something specific.
      @import : used to bolt another stylesheet onto your existing one. (@import url(morestyles.css);)
      @media : used to apply styles to a specific media, such as print.
      @font-face : for embedding fonts in a web page so that a typeface can be used even if it isn’t on user’s computer.
