#SQL
Structured query language - can only query if the data is structured.

DB - collection of data(meaningful information).
DBMS - Application that is used to manipulate the db.
    DDL - Data defination language (Used to manipulate the schema
        (Create, Alter, Drop)
    DML - Data manipulation language (used to manipulate the data)
        (Insert, Update, Delete, Select)

#connection properties
    - host : where the data locate
    - username : user for access the db
    - password : passphrase for the particular user 

Table - Entity
Row - Record - Tuples
Columns - Attributes - Fields
student(student_id), enrollment(enrollment_id)

#Keys
    - Primary key : set of one or more fields of a table that uniquely identify the record(no null, no duplicates) 
    - foreign key : field of a table that is primary key in another table 
    - Composite Key : combination of more than one columns of a table.
    - Candidate Key : can work as a primary key
    - Alternate key : that can be work as primary key but not primary key
    - Unique key : similiar to primary key but can have an one null
    - super key : set pf one or more than key

#Basic Querys
    #DDL
    - SHOW DATABASES : view all the databases in particular host
    - USE <db_name> : to choose the database 
    - CREATE DATABASE <db_name> : to create the database 
    - CREATE TABLE <tbl_name>(<clm_name> <data_type(size)> *<special_condition>, ...)
    - DESCRIBE/DESC <tbl_name> : to view the details of table

    #DML
    - INSERT INTO <tbl_name> (<clm_name1>, <clm_name2>, <clm_name3>) VALUES (<val1>, <val2>, <val3>);
        To add the records into the table.
    - SELECT * FROM <tbl_name> 
        to get the all records from table.
    - SELECT <clm_name>,.... FROM <tbl_name>;
        to get selected columns details from table.
    - UPDATE <tbl_name> SET <clm_name> = <value>,.... WHERE <clm_name> = <value>;
        to update the selected fields in the table.
    - DELETE FROM <tbl_name> WHERE <clm_name> = <value>
        to delete the records from table according to the condition
    
        - WHERE : Searching Criterias
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE 'a%'	Finds any values that start with "a"
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE '%a'	Finds any values that end with "a"
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE '%or%'	Finds any values that have "or" in any position
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE '_r%'	Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE 'a_%_%'	Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
        WHERE <clm_name> LIKE 'a%o'	Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

        = - Equal, <> - Not equal, > - Greater than, <	Less than, >=	Greater than or equal, <=	Less than or equal
        BETWEEN	Between a certain range, LIKE -	Search for a pattern, IN - To specify multiple possible values for a column
#joins  
    - JOIN | INNER JOIN : all records match the condition in both tables
    - OUTER JOIN : 
        LEFT OUTER JOIN | LEFT JOIN : 
            all row from left table in conjuction with matching rows in right table
            SELECT * FROM <tbl_1> LEFT JOIN <tbl_2> ON <tbl_1.PKey> = <tbl_2.PKey>
            it get all the records from left table and matched recors from right table
        RIGHT OUTER JOIN | RIGHT JOIN : 
            same as above but right
            SELECT * FROM <tbl_1> RIGHT JOIN <tbl_2> ON <tbl_1.PKey> = <tbl_2.PKey>
            it get all the records from left table and matched recors from right table

        FULL OUTER | FULL JOIN : return condition not matched values
            SELECT * FROM <tbl_1> OUTER JOIN <tbl_2> ON <tbl_1.PKey> = <tbl_2.PKey>
            get all the records from both tablve even matched or not.
