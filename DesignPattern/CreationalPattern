Factory Method      
    Pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, 
    but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    
    EX :
    interface Human{
        growHair();
    }

    girl implement Human{
        growHair(){
            
        }
    }
    boy implement Human{
        growHair(){

        }
    }

Abstract Factory    
    lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
