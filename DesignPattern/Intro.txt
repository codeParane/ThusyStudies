Design Pattern
general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. 
A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. 
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.



Types of design pattern
- Creational Design Pattern
    provide flexible ways of creating objects, 
    which help to minimize dependencies between classes and maximize code reuse.

- Structural
    structure your classes efficiently, making relations between classes minimal and straightforward.

- Behavioral
    responsible for the efficient and safe distribution of behaviors among the program's objects.
